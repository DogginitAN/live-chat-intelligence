# Privacy Policy for Live Chat Intelligence

**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026

## Overview

Live Chat Intelligence is a Chrome extension that visualizes YouTube Live chat streams. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
- **YouTube Live Chat Messages:** We process public chat messages from YouTube Live streams you are actively watching. This data is processed in real-time and not stored permanently.
- **Video IDs:** We collect the YouTube video ID of streams you connect to in order to fetch the chat.

### What We Do NOT Collect
- Personal identification information
- YouTube account credentials
- Browsing history outside of YouTube Live streams
- Any data when the extension is not actively in use

## Data Processing

- Chat messages are processed on our secure servers to provide:
  - Ticker/stock symbol detection
  - Sentiment analysis (bullish/bearish indicators)
  - Question identification
  - AI-generated summaries
  - Spam filtering

- All processing happens in real-time. We do not store chat messages or analysis results after your session ends.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:
- **Groq API:** For AI-powered text analysis (summaries, spam detection). Only anonymized chat text is sent; no user identifiers are transmitted.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to third parties. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above for the sole purpose of providing the extension's features.

## Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures:
